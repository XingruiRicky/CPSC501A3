Inspector using java reflection

In this project, I used only one branch because all function implementations are linear and there is no need for function parallel development. When I first started implementing the inspect function, I had already planned the steps of the function implementation: splitting the function into subparts to avoid Long function, and designing the paramenter type to ensure any problems with the parameter (too long/redundant). In the process of implementing the function, I have used my Assignment1 code for manual testing. After the function was completed, I wrote Junit test for the sub-function of inspect and changed the return value of the sub-function from to be used for testing (previously it was void) The test only contains the base test because the expected output of the function is very redundant and difficult to compare using too complex Object.
